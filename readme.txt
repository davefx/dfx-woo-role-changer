This WordPress plugin allows the association of a role to a WooCommerce product so the role will be assigned to a registered user
when the product is purchased.

== How it works ==

Once activated, every product will have an additional *Role to be assigned to people purchasing this product* option in the general tab of the product edition page, where administrators will be able to select the role to be immediately assigned to people who completes the payment for an order including the configured product.
