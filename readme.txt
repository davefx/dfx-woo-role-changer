This plugin allows the association of a role to a WooCommerce product so the role is assigned to a registered user when the product is purchased.

== How it works ==

Once activated, every product will have an additional *Role to be assigned to people purchasing this product* option in the general tab of the product edition page, where administrators will be able to select the role to be immediately assigned to people who completes the payment for an order including the configured product.
 

== Changelog ==

* Adding new feature to select when the role must be assigned to the user.
* Adding new mode selection, to determine if the new role must be added to the user or if the new role just should replace any previous role.
* Added code to be executed if the order gets cancelled or refunded, to remove the role from the user.
